    "\n",
    "This is my contrinution to the F# Advent Calendar 2022, which is a relatively short post on using F# to help solve Wordle.\n",
    "For those who've been living under a rock this year, Wordle is a word guessing game created by Josh Wardle, and now owned by the NY Times.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game involves iteratively attempting to guess a secret word, with each guess 'scored' against this secret word. If the guess word's letter is in the correct position in the secret word, then that letter is scored as Green. If it's in the word but not in the correct position then Yellow, and Grey if it's not contained in the word.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You continue to guess until the game is won - where each letter is scored Green - or you run out out attempts.  You only get six attempts to guess the word.\n",
    "\n",
    " I found a dictionary of words on the internet, so will use this in order to create a collection of five letter words.  For those of you familiar with wordle, you'll know that the way Josh structured the game, is that that the Worlde is selected from a set of 2315 words, but each word you guess is checked to ensure that it exists in a much larger population of words (approx 11,000).  This may have changed somewhat since the NY Times bought wordle from Josh, and also since they now use a dedicated word setter, rather than using Josh's original list. You can scrape these lists from the JavaScript source code, however in order to not spoil things, I will use my internet downloaded set of words. The stats don't change much between the wordle set of words and the internet set of words - as you can see below."
